## Concepts
> - `Dockers`: simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project.
> - `Jenkins`: is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
> - `Artifact`: is a by-product produced during the software development process. It may consist of the project source code, dependencies, binaries or resources, and could be represented in different layout depending on the technology.
> - One of the primary purposes of a `pipeline` is to keep the software development process organized and focused.
